# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Example:
# SERVERVAR="foo"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENTVAR="bar"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_SERVICE=#emailjs_service_id#
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILTOUSER_TEMPLATE=#emailjs_email_template_to_user#
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILTODEV_TEMPLATE=#emailjs_email_template_to_dev#
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=#github personal access token#
EDGE_STORE_ACCESS_KEY=#edgestore access key#
EDGE_STORE_SECRET_KEY=#edgestore secret key#
